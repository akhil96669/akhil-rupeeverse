## Core Features

### 1. Offline-First Banking
RupeeVerse uses a sophisticated offline-first architecture that enables critical banking functions without an internet connection.

#### How Offline Transactions Work:
1. **Local Storage Persistence**: All transactions are initially stored in the browser's localStorage
2. **Transaction Queue**: When offline, transactions are queued with unique IDs and timestamps
3. **Synchronization**: When connectivity returns, the app automatically syncs pending transactions
4. **Conflict Resolution**: The system resolves conflicts if transactions were modified while offline
5. **Verification Mechanism**: Uses cryptographic signatures to verify transaction integrity

**Implementation Details:**
- The `OfflineTransactionContext` provides a global state for managing transactions
- `offlineTransactions.ts` utility handles transaction creation, storage, and syncing
- QR code generation ensures secure transaction information exchange while offline
- Each transaction receives a unique reference code for tracking and verification

### 2. Rupee AI Assistant
RupeeVerse includes two AI assistants to help users with their financial needs:

#### Offline AI Assistant:
- Works entirely without internet connectivity
- Provides basic account information and transaction capabilities
- Uses pre-trained models stored locally
- Supports voice commands in multiple Indian languages
- Processes financial data stored on the device

#### Online Finance Expert:
